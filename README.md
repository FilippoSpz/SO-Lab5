# Docker Container Management Script

This project contains a Bash script (`container.sh`) designed to streamline the process of building, running, stopping, and managing Docker containers for development or deployment environments.

--- 

## Features

- Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile
- Run a container from the image
- Stop and remove the container
- Display logs and container status

---

## Usage

First, ensure that you have Docker installed and running on your machine.

Then, make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x container.sh
```
Each command can be executed by passing it as an argument to the script:

```bash
./container.sh conf-file.txt /command1/command2
```
